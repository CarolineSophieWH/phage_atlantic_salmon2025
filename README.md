# Github repository - Ecological strategies of bacteria shape inherent phage diversity in Atlantic salmon gut
This github repository includes the code and analytical framework to generate the results and dataset that are reported by Winther-Have et al. 2025 (unpublished).
Here we provide three files: 1) Entire pipeline for the viral community analysis from raw .fq.gz files to the final vOTU table. 2) Generation of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) using Anvi'o pipeline v8. 3) R script for the statistics and visualisation of the 16S rRNA amplicaon data and vOTUs.  

Background: Virus-like particles (VLP)-metagenomes were retrieved from distal gut content samples from a cohort of sick and healthy phenotypes of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).

Summary: Viral communities were identified and profilled across samples, which with 16S rRNA amplicon data, were grouped based on their dominant bacteria. 

The 16S rRNA data from the same samples, was generated and is publically available by Bozzi et al 2020 (https://github.com/DavideBozzi/Bozzi_et_al_2020_analysis) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s42523-021-00096-2
